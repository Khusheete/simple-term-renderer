# Simple Terminal Renderer 
 A *linux* terminal renderer library for rust inspired by the processing project.
 (It was previously named "Termkan" though I renamed it to be more representative of what it is)

Disclaimer: This crate is an experiment to see if I could create a terminal graphical tool.
It might get updates (sixel, regis), or it might not, I don't know.


# Tests

To run a test, use the command:
`cargo test *test_name* -- --nocapture 2>err.log`
